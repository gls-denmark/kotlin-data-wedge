/**
 * This feature configures DataWedge to select an external scanner as the default scanning device immediately upon connection and revert to a built-in scanner when the external scanner is disconnected.
 * External scanners include those connecting by Bluetooth, serial cable or snap-on module. If enabled, SWITCH_SCANNER should not be used upon scanner connection/disconnection as it can cause unexpected behavior.
 * Disabled by default. Available only when â€œAuto" is selected in the Scanner selection panel.
 *
 * This feature is intended to help reduce scanning workflow interruptions when a Bluetooth scanner is introduced and/or it becomes disconnected by losing power or moving out of range.
 *
 * For Bluetooth scanners, if the device was not previously paired, a pairing barcode is displayed prior to automatic connection.
